# CRossFit
CRossFit is designed to give you an efficient guide of working out. I'm designing this project because I like most people with busy time-consuming jobs, have limited free-time. For those of you looking for the most efficient way to workout, CRossFit is that solution. Enter the 80/20 Principle applied to CrossFit movements. CRossFit is intended to analyze the 20% of movements in CrossFit that work 80% of the muscles.

CRossFit analyzes a list of CrossFit movements and their respective muscles worked, then consolidates these movements into three categories: Monostructural, Gymnastics, & Weightlifting. After these movements have been categorized, CRossFit details what movements should be done in order of the amount of muscles worked. It's important to know what areas of the body are worked and what muscle groups each movement targets.

There is working out, and then there is working out with deliberate practice. CRossFit allows you to workout with purpose and achieve your fitness goals!
